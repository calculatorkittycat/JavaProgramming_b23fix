1- Checked vs Unchecked

    Checked: Unwanted Event

        -occurs in compile time
        -it Must be handled otherwise code will not compile
        -Easy to catch
        -Solution
            -Try Catch
            -throws


    Unchecked: Unexpected Event

        -Occurs in runtime( All unchecked exception are runtime exceptions)
        -Code will compile, but not run
        -Not easy to catch
        -Solution
            -Try Catch

2- Try Catch

        -can be used for both checked and unchecked exceptions

        MULTIPLE TRY CATCH

        - Try block will be capable of throwing exception one or more
          If we dont know exception type we should use multiple catch blocks to catch it

        Rule: Parent exception type cannot be placed before Child
