    /*
    Yestday was May 20th 2021
    I created my hello world project. I struggled with remembering the public static void main(String[] args){}
    order of text!! and I am still struggling a little bit but ive got 90% of it. which feels good. I almost wish there
    was no shortcut like main and pressing the enter key which will create the main method line for you, because i liked
    typing it and trying to remember it.
