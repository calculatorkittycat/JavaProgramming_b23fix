Abstract Class Vs Interface

abstract extends interface implements

Both are used for achieving abstraction
Both are meant to be inherited
Both can not create objects
Both can not be final, because final can not be inherited


Abstract Class:
One class can only extend on abstract class
Has to be the parent and will only contain the common features
Can have everything a regular class can
4 access modifiers in abstract class


Interface:
One class can implement multiple interfaces
Variable: public static final default
Methods: abstract method, static method, default method
One access modifier in interface

Will only contain the features that the subclass will need to implement
